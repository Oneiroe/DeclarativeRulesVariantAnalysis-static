This folder contains the batch file to reproduce the experiments reported in the paper titled:

"Detection of statistically significant differences between process variants through declarative rules"
A. Cecconi, A. Augusto, C. Di Ciccio


The batch files are designed to run in a Windows environment.
To run the batch test and locate the outputs, please do the following:

1. extract the logs.zip content and copy all the batch files into the folder containing the following two Jar files:

	MINERful.jar
	Janus.jar 
	
2. run the batch test(s)

3. the declarative process models will be saved in the form of JSON and CSV files in the folder "logs"

4. the files containing the statistically-significant differences between the two input logs will be saved in the same folder of the batch files
